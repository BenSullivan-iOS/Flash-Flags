# Flash-Flags
Swift 3 Vexillology app currently in development.

I have used my interpretation of VIPER arcitecture along with Protocol Oriented Programming focusing on Value Types over Classes.

This is the first GitHub project utilising iOS 10's tableView prefetching API, if you need any help with this then feel free to get in touch.

Ignore the UI as it is just the MVP! :)
