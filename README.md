# Flash-Flags
Swift 3 Vexillology app currently in development.

I have used my interpretation of VIPER arcitecture along with Protocol Oriented Programming focusing on Value Types over Classes.

This project also utilises iOS 10's prefetching API for smooth scrolling within the Game and Filter Flags UIs.

Ignore the UI as it is just the MVP! :)
