//Main table needs to update with played games

Game starts in GameVC

-> Could go to GameInteractor -> Core Data Store

-> Once stored, GameWireframe presents the MainVC

-> MainVC loads whatever is in Core Data


First test logic - Pass Game object directly to the MainVC and present on screen in section 1
